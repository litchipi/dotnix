# Problems on the systems

## Sparta

### Brightness setting doesn't work

I think it's linked to DBus as gnome-settings uses this (I think) to
set the brightness. See [this article](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/dbus)

This may also be related to the Gnome extensions problems

### Can't install extensions from gnome-extensions.org

Probably a DBus problem also

### WiFi can't restart after hibernation sometimes

Check the logs to see the issue

Maybe a driver problem

### Plymouth boot screen doesn't appear

Maybe because of luks encryption
